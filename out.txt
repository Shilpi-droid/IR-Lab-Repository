investigations make wave system create static pressure distribution liquid surface
anyone investigate effect shock generate vorticity heat transfer blunt body
heat transfer blunt body absence vorticity
general effect flow field reynolds number small
find calculation procedure applicable incompressible laminar boundary layer flow problems good accuracy reasonable computation time
paper applicable problem calculation procedures laminar incompressible flow arbitrary pressure gradient
anyone investigate shear buckle stiffen plat
paper shear buckle unstiffened rectangular plat shear
practice close reality assumptions flow hypersonic shock tube use nitrogen nonviscous thermodynamic equilibrium
design factor use control liftdrag ratios mach number 5
